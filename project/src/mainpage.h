 *Run doxygen and open up the index.html file and you will see how this is presented. In this iteration, communicate to other programmers the general structure of this software including the key Model-Viewer-Controller aspects. You do not need to describe the Braitenberg vehicles and behaviors, but include a link that describes it. Provide general guidance in how to understand the code structure and how to modify it. Think back to the first time that you saw this code -- what is the critical information that you needed to understand the code?

The minimum requirement for text is 3 paragraphs. If you were to print it out with 1.5 line spacing, it should take at least 1 page.
