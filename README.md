# repo-strob105

Hello! I'm adding this after the fact, just for the record.

This code was created as part of my class on Program Design (CSCI3081W at the University of Minnesota). 

The purpose of the project was ostensibly to heavily modify a given simulation of braitenberg vehicles, but in reality it was training on version control and good practice.

This was last run on ubuntu in 2019, so I'm not sure if it will still be compatible with current operating systems.
